# Python Practice Repo

"Try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try and live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations." - Monty Python's The Meaning of Life

This repository will document my journey through the Python3 tutorial found at: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. 
Although I have programmed in Python before, I want to rebuild my fundamentals in a more structured way. 

There are 15 chapters in this tutorial. The goal is (as written in the tutorial) to "able to read and write Python modules and programs, and be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library." Setting myself a deadline of a month to finish this.

## Timeline

August 13 - Started the tutorial and made the repository. Have to take a few days break due to final exams.

August 20 - Finished till Chapter 4 of the tutorial.
