# Python Practice Repo

This repository will document my journey through the Python3 tutorial found at: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html. 
Although I have programmed in Python before, I want to rebuild my fundamentals in a more structured way. 

There are 15 chapters in this tutorial. The goal is (as written in the tutorial) to "able to read and write Python modules and programs, and be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in The Python Standard Library." Setting myself a deadline of a month to finish this.
